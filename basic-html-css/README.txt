This is an intro level TODO project based on basic html, css and a touch of javascript. 

The project only requires index.htm and the 2 subdirectories img/ and js/. All 8 of the TODOs are inside comments in index.htm.

index#.htm is what the page should look like when you're starting each of the 8 steps. The file index3.htm would have the changes expected from TODO 1 and TODO2. 

index-end.htm has what the end result could be if you followed exactly as I intended. 

If your solution is different, it's not wrong. It's yours.
